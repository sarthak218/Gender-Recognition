# Gender-Recognition

Handwritten character recognition is one of the practically important issues in pattern recognition applications. The main purpose of this project is to build an automatic handwritten digit recognition method for the recognition of handwritten digit strings. 
To accomplish the recognition task, first, the digits will be segmented into individual digits. Then, a digit recognition module is employed to classify each segmented digit completing the handwritten digit string recognition task. 
The applications of digit recognition include postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry, etc. The heart of the problem lies within the ability to develop an efficient algorithm that can recognize handwritten digits and which is submitted by users by the way of a scanner, tablet, and other digital devices.
